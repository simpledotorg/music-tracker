# MusicTracker README

This is a small Rails 6 app meant for working through pair programming exercises with Simple.org hiring candidates.
The basic idea of this app is that it would become a small, web based music catalog / tracking application.
Imagine a vastly simplified version of Spotify or Apple Music on the web.


# How to Setup

Requires Postgres, ruby 2.6.5, and yarn.
